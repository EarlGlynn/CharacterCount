To annoy C experts who hated Delphi and Pascal in the early 1980s, I created the "legible.h" C macros to make C look like Pascal <g>.  That was liked even less.

charcnt is quite old, but it still compiles with the make file in CentOS:

    make -f charcnt.mak
    make -f charcnt2.mak

In Windows with Rtools installed, there is a gcc compiler:  c:\Rtools\mingw_32\bin\gcc.exe
With C:\Rtools\mingw_32\bin in the path, compile as follows:

     gcc charcnt.c  legible.h -ocharcnt
     gcc charcnt2.c legible.h -ocharcnt2
